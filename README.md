# blitz-auction
Blitz auctions run in short, fixed time slices instead of continuous bidding, so all bids in a slice are treated as if they arrived simultaneously. At the end of each slice, the auction clears in one shot, typically at a single “uniform” price for that round. This reduces last‑second sniping and latency advantages.
